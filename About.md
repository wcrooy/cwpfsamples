# Introduction #

While presented with the challenge to work on WPF composite applications I've found it difucult to learn so many technologies all at once. WPF is a completely different model to the old Windows Forms model and requires a vastly different way of thinking. My goal of this project is to help others with the knowledge I have obtained whilst learning.

I encourage anyone to request to contribute on this project by starting individual solutions or working on some of the solutions I have come up with to help others with your ideas.

There are many problems that can be solved in a variety of ways, in many cases there is not a "one size fits all" solution to any one problem and thus I wish to solve problems in different ways and explain why one alternative might be used over another.

The following is an example of my first project that encompases just a few of these problems. What we have here is a tabbed browser or master region to the left where modules can register components, then to the right we have a document container where documents can be opened and managed through the lifecycle of the application. This is the first sample I will be submitting.

# Mission Statement #

Collaborate and aid others in the development of Composite WPF applications by providing solutions to common and not so common problems.

# Who am I #

I'm an individual contributor who wishes to communicate with other users in the same boat and explore possibilities together. I am working for a private company as an analyst programmer, this means I may at times cite the company I am working for but they are not affiliated with this project.
