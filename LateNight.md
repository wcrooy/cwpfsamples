# Introduction #

Late night is a reimplementation of the first program I wrote (ProductPrism). The goals of LateNight are to reiterate over lessons learned while creating ProductPrism and remove organizational references.

# Details #

LateNight is now available within the SVN repository. I have created the basic implementation and a script of all my actions. I've also added a new log-on screen that was not present in the ProductPrism sample that demonstrates how a log-on procedure might be performed. This will soon be extended to use a service that allows pluggable login modules to be loaded and consumed before the shell has been created.


# Future of Product Prism #

ProductPrism will eventually be removed from this project with all of the lessons learned and functionality replicated into LateNight and other project solutict solutions.
